## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository of my internship project at the university of SÃ¸nderbog in Denmark for creating an artificial intelligence model for traffic sign detection. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting and recognizing, initially, road traffic signs from images and, subsequently, vandalized signs. This GitHub contains the various methods that allowed me to develop the model and the different techniques used to improve the model's performance.

## Context

Traffic sign detection is a crucial task for autonomous driving systems and road safety applications. This project aims to create a detection model based on deep learning.

Traffic signs are crucial for maintaining road safety.

Non-compliant signs can cause:

- Confusion for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians.
- An increase in the number of accidents and traffic violations.

## Objectives

1. Collect and preprocess a dataset of traffic sign images.
2. Develop a deep learning model for the detection and recognition of traffic signs.
3. Evaluate the model's performance.
4. Improve the model's performance.
5. Integrate the model into a drone.
